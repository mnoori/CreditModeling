In this project, I will explore the Lending Club's dataset on the approved and declined loan requests from 2007 until 2011. 

The goal of analyis is:
* Can we build a machine learning model that can accurately predict if a borrower will pay off their loan on time or not?
Data is available on their website [(please see here)](https://www.lendingclub.com/info/download-data.action)
